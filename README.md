Replay
======

**Writing for re-use to avoid repeating the same task twice. A practical set of Git conventions.**

## Overview

This single-session workshop presents some Git tools and conventions which allows to build repositories with a replayable git history.
The main idea is to avoid repetitions of tasks by re-using not only static pieces of code but also entire codebase transformations (something like re-using entire pieces of history).

## Audience

Basic Git knowledge is required. Reminders are provided for all key-principles, but branch switching, commiting, and fetching remote changes are assumed to be activities the audience is familiar with.
